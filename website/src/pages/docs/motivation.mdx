# Motivation

React supports SVG out of the box, it's simpler, easier and much more powerful
to have components instead of SVG files. Wrapped in a React component, your SVG
is inlined in the page and you can style it using CSS.

SVGR differs from other library by its solid architecture. It uses [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/) + [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to transform SVG code into JavaScript code.

SVGR is included in [create-react-app v2](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and gives you the power to [import SVG directly as a React component](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files#adding-svgs).
